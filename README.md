# python-game-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for a simple game built with Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9.1.

## Cloning it
You *can* `git clone` it, but it would be much easier to clone this boilerplate with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp). Once you've installed bp, clone the boilerplate like this:

```sh
$ bp code-boilerplates/python-game my-awesome-game
```

(Replace `my-awesome-game` with the name of your game.)

You're now good to go!

## Running it
This is just one step:

```sh
$ python starter.py
```

`starter.py` is the file where most of your code will go.
